# UNet-from-scratch
My UNet implementation

# UNet Model
I created UNet from scratch using the original UNet paper
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597
I strictly followed the architecture of the model shown in the paper

# Training
for the training set and codes, I used a file from one of the courses that I took from deeplearning.ai
